    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ pound ground pork</li>
        <li>½ pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
        <li>1 can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1 clove crushed garlic</li>
        <li>½ teaspoons dried basil</li>
        <li>½ teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 package lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 pound small-curd cottage cheese</li>
        <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 package shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine <span>pork</span> and <span>ground beef</span> in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add <span>onion</span> and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in <span>crushed tomatoes</span>, <span>tomato sauce</span>, 1 tablespoon <span>fresh parsley</span>, <span>garlic</span>, <span>basil</span>, <span>salt</span>, <span>oregano</span>, and <span>sugar</span>. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook <span>lasagna noodles</span> in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 190 degrees C.</li>
        <li>Mix <span>cottage cheese</span>, <span>Parmesan cheese</span>, <span>eggs</span>, remaining 1 tablespoon <span>fresh parsley</span>, <span>salt</span>, and <span>pepper</span> in a large bowl until combined.</li>
        <li>Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat it. Place two layers of noodles over the sauce to cover. Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the <span>mozzarella cheese</span>. Repeat layers once more using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and <span>mozzarella</span>. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.</li>
    </ol>
